Late morning, one too many Guinesses last night but had to celebrate. Gambit is not happy with me. I say okay okay and put on my coat and we go outside. The cold smacks me across the face. It is March 18th, isn't this pretty much spring? Snow, wind, cold, probably mid 20's. I begin regretting going with the Xfinity wind breaker promo from '21, bad choice. Sun hits my face as I am thinking about my Sox Nike Dugout Performance Full-Zip - wait, what? Sun? In the middle of a snowstorm?

A smile crosses my face, and I feel like a bear emerging from hibernation. First time I have seen sun in who knows how long. Jose was bringing groceries inside and we caught each others eyes and had a laugh. Spring is coming, and with that a new Sox season. And with a new Sox season, a new Sox hat. I take Gambit in and grab Jueles and we head to Grandstand in the Accord. 

Hasely had 3 hits yesterday vs the Cubs in Spring Training, still can’t forgive him for what he did to Mendick last year though. Eloy was back in the lineup a day after playing in the WBC. Its lunchtime now and I still haven’t ate yet today so I stop at Kathy De’s and ask Jules what she wants but she says she doesn’t want anything. I feel bad for stopping now but do anyways. The World Baseball Classic really has me thinking that the Sox could go over .500 this year. Tim, Lynn, Moncada, all look great. Eloy and Robert look good as well. Walking out of Kathy De’s now, sun on the face and a Billy Boy in hand excited. 

I’m worried Jueles is mad at me so I ask if she wants to stop for coffee to smooth things over. She says yes, so I think we are cool. Stop at Stockyard because it is right by Kathy De’s. I get an iced coffee with a splash of cream but I end up getting a cream with a splash of coffee. oh well, always preferred Bridgeport coffee.  We head north up to Grandstand. 

Jueles is in the food bag fishing for fries. If you wanted fries you should have ordered fries I tell her. I am hungry, I need my fries I say. She is mad, wants fries though. I think maybe we aren’t as cool as I thought. I need my fries, I say, but we can go to 35th Red Hots and you can get fries and I can walk to Grandstand. Okay, okay she says but wants me to go with her to 35th. So now I am in line at 35th thinking about how I was in the same spot feeling good with Jueles last year for the season opener. Sox lost 5-4 in Detroit, but I was excited for the season, thought we were going to be good. Sometimes I can be a dummy, and sometimes baseball mean. 

Maybe I am being a dummy now. I was feeling good last year but we stunk, maybe we still stink. Jueles fries are ready. Back in the Accord, I am now jealous of Jueles fries and slide a lemme get a fry but she rejects. If you wanted fries you should have got fries she says. Kathy’s fries are good, but 35th has the best. Sometimes you got to be happy with just good fries though. 

If ’22 season was a fry it would be a Morrie O’Malley’s fry. Not good. But that place isn’t around anymore, probably because O’that (ha). I am driving by that lot now, probably going to be some 3 flat soon. Heading west on 35th back home. I smell the Billy Boy and can’t wait to sit on the couch and watch Northwestern v UCLA and eat it. Not the biggest Northwestern guy but I will root for them against the damn Californias, that’s for sure. And I've been watching the Boo Buie kid, I think he can make a difference. 

I get up to the 3rd floor and say hi to Gambit and open a Guiness from last night. Youtube TV just got multi view, cool feature lets me watch more basketball games at once. I sit down with the Billy Boy and take off my hat. I look at the all the dog hair on it, then it hits me. Shoot, I think, maybe you are a dummy. 

Forgot the hat but might as well throw one in the ring and make a prediction. I think the Sox will be 82-80 in 2023. I also think the pitch clock will be a good change, and that I will still be able to drink the same amount of Miller regardless.
